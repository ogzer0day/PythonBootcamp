Game Analytics Dashboard

This script analyzes game data stored in the GameData dictionary. It demonstrates:
- List comprehensions to filter and transform data
- Dictionary comprehensions to summarize player scores and achievements
- Set comprehensions to find unique players, achievements, and game modes
- Generator expressions to compute total players, unique achievements, average score, and identify top performers

Data includes:
- Players with level, total score, sessions played, favorite mode, and achievements
- Individual sessions with player name, score, duration, mode, and completion status
- Metadata including game modes and achievement types

The script prints an analytics dashboard summarizing:
- High scorers and their doubled scores
- Score categories and achievement counts
- Unique players, achievements, and active game modes
- Total players, average score, and top performer
